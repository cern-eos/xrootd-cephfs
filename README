XRootD Xeph Open Storage System Plugin
=======================================

This project contains a plugin for the **XRootD** server which interfaces with
**Ceph** for the storage of data.

Setup
======

This plugin is loaded by the XRootD Server. In order to accomplish this, it is
necessary to indicate the server where the plugin is by adding the following
line to the server's configuration file:

  ofs.osslib /path/to/libCephOss.so

It is necessary to tell which Ceph instance it should interface with. This is done
by adding the following file to the same configuration file indicated above:

  cephoss.config /path/to/your/ceph.conf
